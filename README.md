Facemaker, written by Sebastian Miller.

An app that allows the user to customize a face. The color of the skin, hair, and eyes are entirely up to the user's disgression, as well as the choice of hair out of three.
There is also a randomize button that randomizes all of the colors as well as the hairstyle.

Known Issues: 
  -  SeekBars do not update when the randomize button is pressed.
  -  Spinner does not update when the randomize button is pressed.
